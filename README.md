# 🕹️ Becoming a Game Dev Warrior

Hi! I’m Abdul Mannan, and welcome to my journey of **becoming a Game Dev Warrior**.

In this series, I’m building a bunch of game dev projects week by week — learning new things, solving real dev problems, and sharing the full process as I go.

Project 01 is an **Endless Runner** — but with a twist: it's horror-themed 👻

## 🔥 Week 01 Progress

Here’s everything I worked on in the first week:

### ✅ Game Design
- Wrote a simple **Game Design Document** (GDD) to structure the project

### ✅ Player & Camera
- Added plane for the ground
- Placed a capsule as the player
- Used **Cinemachine** to make the camera follow the player smoothly
- Implemented basic **player movement**: swipe left/right to change lanes, swipe up to jump

### ✅ Object Pooling & Level Generation
- Learned and implemented **object pooling** for better performance
- Built a basic **pool manager** to reuse game objects
- Created infinite level segments, **collectables**, and **obstacles** using pooling

### ✅ Obstacles & Interactions
- Generated coins in randomized chunks, avoiding overlap
- Added two types of obstacles (dodge by jumping/sliding)
- Implemented **slide mechanic** by lowering capsule collider and speed on swipe down

### ✅ Power-Ups
- **Invisible Power-Up**: lets player pass through obstacles with increased speed
- **Magnet Power-Up**: pulls coins from a distance
